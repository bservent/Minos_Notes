#MACHINE LEARNING

#Translates real life problems into data so that it can be numerically represented and clear
#Quantify observations into numbers so the computer can understand find patterns that it can see

#Strengths = following instructions, seeing patterns in large quatitavtive data sets, performs large amount of calculations without errors, transform data

#Weaknesses = creating their own instructions, thinking critically

#RGB = Red, Green, Blue = numbers for colors

#Linear Regression

#linear regression is continuous data(ex. temperature, height, what we will be focusing on)
#classification is categorical data (ex. hot or cold, apples, oranges)
#uses line to create relationship between two variables, one variable being the determining factor and the other being the dependent variable (ex. height and weight)
