//WHY PYTHON? 
//It is a simple programming language (reads very neanderthal like) and offers alot of structure when working with large quantities of data (much more than what shell scripts and batch files can offer)
//It has a lot of "batteries included functionality" such as flexible arrays and dictionaries
//It is an interpreted language which makes it easy to experiment and test functions during bottom-up program development

//SYNTAX
//uses new lines to complete code (no semicolons or parethesis)
//use indentation to define scope of functions, loops, classes (other languages usually use curly brackets)
//indentation is very impoortant = block of code
//no variable command...you just declare it (ex: x = 5)

//Elif and Else
//the elif is saying "if this condition is not met than try this"
//else catches anything that is left in the end of a conditional statements

//FUNTIONS
//a function is a block of code that is called to execute
//it can retreive data and take in known parameters
//in python def is used to define a function
