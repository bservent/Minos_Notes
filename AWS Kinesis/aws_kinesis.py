#AWS kinesis

#managed scalable cloud-based service that streams large amounts of data per second
#it is used to capture, store, and process large data streams in real time from things such as events logs and social media feeds
#after processing data, Kineses distributes it to multiple consumers simultaneously
#no need to batch up data - stream data to Kinesis as soon as its produced
#stream real-time graphs
#real-time data analytics

#strengths = ability to process, huge loads of data, integrates well with loT Platform on Amazon, scalability, easy to learn, analyze data in real time, and fast streaming

#weaknesses = not a queue system, so little visibility into "backlog" if there is any, and some issues with operating along with AWS lambda
